A few weeks ago, Canadian Prime Minister **Mark Carney** reached an understanding with **Xi Jinping**, to slash tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China into Canada, in exchange for full tariff exemptions on Canadian agricultural exports. **U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer** arrived in Beijing this week, to mend relations with China. **German Chancellor Friedrich Merz** and **Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo** are among other European leaders seeking companionship with Beijing.

A question arises. What is going on? Why is Washington losing its allies to its arch rival?

The answer lies far beyond trade. Washington’s push towards asserting control of Greenland, and its subsequent pressuring of European allies to further this end, has become the igniter of such measures. European nations have opposed U.S. control of Greenland, amid persistent fears that retribution for this may present itself as tariffs.

With the current state of the world’s economy, no nation wants to face an encore of the mid-2025 disruptions triggered by U.S. trade actions. Combined with the perception that Washington has stopped playing leader and started acting as an enforcer of its own whims, European states have naturally turned their attention to China.

Reactions to these developments have been diverse. “Instead of creating a united front against China, we’re pushing our closest allies into their arms,” **U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen**, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a hearing this week. **U.S. President Donald Trump** said, “It is very dangerous for them (U.K.) to do that (seek a partnership with China).” **European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas** acknowledged that China poses a long-term challenge because of its “economic coercive practices,” but added, “like I say, reach out to different partnerships, with different countries across the world.”

While Washington remains critical of its allies for seeking out Beijing, it is worth noting that **Donald Trump** will also visit China in the near future, for mostly the same reasons: the gargantuan economy, central place in geopolitics, and a need to establish stable trade lines. “Everyone goes to Beijing, including the guy who doesn’t want us to go to China,” said **Joerg Wuttke**, former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.
