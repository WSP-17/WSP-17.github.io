On 22 December 2025, India and New Zealand completed negotiations on a landmark Free Trade Agreement (FTA), cementing a new strategic partnership between the two countries. The negotiations were completed in record time, just under nine months (16 March 2025 to 22 December 2025). The deal was the third in a row for India, with the previous ones being the India-UK FTA in July and India-Oman Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in December last year. 

The agreement included zero-duty access on the vast majority of Indian tariff lines, while allowing India to fully protect its agricultural and dairy sectors, upon which the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of Indians depend. Besides the conventional freedoms provided to the IT, textile and pharmaceutical sectors in every deal, this time, soft power exports (such as Ayurvedic and Unani medicines, classical Indian music, and yoga services, among others) were also a part of this unusually broad agreement, effectively turning India's cultural strengths into export opportunities. 

India also demanded and achieved a Temporary Employment Entry (TEE) visa, which allows up to 5,000 Indian professionals at any given time to stay and work in New Zealand for up to three years. Also, numerical caps on student visas were removed, allowing unlimited student visas to Indian nationals alongside a 20-hour-per-week right to work for students. 

In response to these asymmetrical negotiation outcomes, there has been an outcry from some New Zealand politicians and think tanks, who argue that India has been granted more favourable terms than New Zealand's Oceanic neighbour, Australia.

The takeaway: From India's perspective, the deal represents a highly favourable outcome, given that India got New Zealand to agree to most of its major demands, while offering relatively modest market-access gains to New Zealand. It reflects India's growing power on the global stage and is one of many decisions that India has taken to mitigate the losses, real or potential, suffered due to the tariff fiasco raised by the U.S. last year. A question remains: can Indian exporters and businesses capitalize on the concessions and scale fast enough to fully exploit the openings created by the deal.
