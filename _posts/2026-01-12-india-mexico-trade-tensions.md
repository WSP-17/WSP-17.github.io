Mexico's forthcoming implementation of a new tariff system, scheduled for January 1, 2026, represents a crucial shift in its trade policy, with notable implications for exporters from India. By implementing tariffs ranging from 5% to 50% on 1,463 product categories from countries without Free Trade Agreements (FTAs), Mexico aims to strengthen its domestic manufacturing sector and strategically position itself in anticipation of the 2026 review of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The repercussions for India are substantial. Approximately $5.75 billion in annual exports are now at risk, with the automotive industry facing the most severe impact; tariffs on passenger vehicles are expected to rise from 20% to 50%. This "unilateral" policy adjustment, likely designed to counteract Chinese transshipment, places Indian products at a competitive disadvantage compared to those from regions with FTA protections. 

Key sectors such as machinery, chemicals, and textiles may experience a reduction in market share as the cost of goods increases. In response, the Indian government has intensified diplomatic efforts, seeking exemptions and a delay in the implementation of these tariffs. More critically, both nations have accelerated negotiations for a bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or a more specific Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Establishing the Terms of Reference (ToR) for such an agreement has become a priority. A formal trade agreement is the only sustainable solution to protect Indian industries from geopolitical protectionism and to ensure the continued strength of the India-Mexico economic partnership.
